0.8.0

- Support for Gradle 1.10
- Fixed issue 64302: Add renderscript support mode jar to the dependencies in the IDE model.
- Fixed issue 64094: buildConfigField can now replace previous values inside the same type/flavors.
- Add support for NDK prebuilts in library projects.
- Parallelize pre-dexing to speed up clean builds.
- Added 'provided' dependency scope for compile only (not packaged) dependencies.
  Additional scope per buildtype and flavors are also available (debugProvided, myFlavorProvided,etc...)
- Fix NDK on windows.
- Variant API improvements:
   * getPreBuild() returns the prebuild task for the variant
   * getSourceSets() returns the sorted sourcesets for the task, from lower to higher priority
   * createZipAlignTask(String taskName, File inputFile, File outputFile)
     This creates and return a new zipalign task. Useful if you have a custom plugin providing custom signing of APKs.
     This also makes the assemble task depend on the new zipalign task, and wires variant.getOutputFile() to return the result of the zipalign task.

0.7.1

- DSL to exclude some files coming from jar dependencies
    android {
      packagingOptions {
        exclude 'META-INF/LICENSE.txt'
      }
    }


0.7.0
- Requires Gradle 1.9
- You can now have a variant specific source folder if you have flavors.
  Only for app (not library or test). Name is src/flavorDebug/... or src/flavor1Flavor2Debug/
  (note the camelcase naming, with lower case for first letter).
  Its components (res, manifest, etc...) have higher priority than components from build type
  or flavors.
  There is also a "flavor combination" source folder available when more than one
  flavor dimension is used.
  For instance src/flavor1Flavor2/
  Note that this is for all combinations of *all* dimensions.
- Build config improvements and DSL changes.
  The previous DSL proprety:
    buildConfigLine "<value>"
  has changed to
    buildConfigField "<type>", "<name>", "<value>"
  You can only add a single field at a time.
  This allows override a field (see 'basic' sample)
  Also, BuildConfig now automatically contains constants for
  PACKAGE_NAME, VERSION_CODE, VERSION_NAME, BUILD_TYPE, FLAVOR as well as FLAVOR_<group> if there are several flavor dimensions.
- Switch to ProGuard 4.10
   - Added ability to test proguarded (obfuscated) apps.
- New option on product Flavor (and defaultConfig) allow filtering of resources through the -c option of aapt
  You can pass single or multiple values through the DSL. All values from the default config and flavors get combined and passed to aapt.
  The DSL is
     resConfig "en"
  or
     resConfigs "nodpi","hdpi"

- Jar files are now pre-dexed for faster dexing.
  Incremental dexing is disabled by default as it can lead to increased dex file size.
- First pass at NDK integration. See the samples.
- API to add new generated source folders:
     variant.addJavaSourceFoldersToModel(sourceFolder1, sourceFolders2,...)
  This adds the source folder to the model (for IDE support).
  Another API:
     variant.registerJavaGeneratingTask(task, sourceFolder1, sourceFolders2,...)
  This automatically adds the dependency on the task, sets up the JavaCompile task inputs and propagates
  the folders to the model for IDE integration.
  See sample 'genFolderApi'
- API to add extra artifacts on variants. This will allow to register Java or Android artifacts, for instance
  for alternative test artifacts.
  See sample 'artifactApi' for the API (sample is not meant to be used, it's for testing).
- Revamped lint integration. Lint is now run as part of the check task, and will analyze all variants and then
  merge the results and create a report which lists which variants each error applies to (unless an error
  applies to all variants). You can also run lint on a specific variant, e.g. lintDebug or lintFreeRelease.
  Lint will no longer report errors in AAR libraries. This version of the plugin also picks up some new lint
  checks.
  A new DSL allows configuration of lint from build.gradle. This is read and used in Studio
- Fixed issue with parentActivityName when handling different package name in the manifest merger.
- Allow files inside META-INF/ from jars to be packaged in the APK.
- Disabled incremental dx mode as it can lead to broken dex files.

0.5.7

- Proguard support for libraries.
  Note the current DSL property 'proguardFiles' for library now sets the proguard rule file used when proguarding the library code.
  The new property 'consumerProguardFiles' is used to package a rule file inside an aar.
- Improved IDE support, including loading project with broken dependencies and anchor task to generate Java code
- New hook tasks: preBuild and prebuild<VariantName>
- First lint integration. This is a work in progress and therefore the lint task is not added to the check task.
- Enable compatibility with 1.8

0.5.6

  will required.
- Fixed IDE model to contain the output file even if it's customized
  through the DSL. Also fixed the DSL to get/set the output file on the
  variant object so that it's not necessary to use variant.packageApplication
  or variant.zipAlign
- Fixed dependency resolution so that we resolved the combination of (default config,
  build types, flavor(s)) together instead of separately.

  of the library itself.
